### MetLife Registration Process - Detailed Technical Documentation

#### Overview:
The MetLife registration process involves multiple complex interactions between various systems, APIs, and databases to securely validate and register users. Below is a detailed breakdown of the registration workflow and underlying technical components involved.

#### Initial Registration:
Users receive a vanity URL via email or direct postal mail from their employer or MetLife, directing them to register their online account. The vanity URL is temporary and redirects users to a general online portal (`online.metlife.com`). Users can also directly access registration via the "Register Now" button on MetLifeâ€™s main website.

#### User Categories:
1. **Group Benefits Users**: Employees registering through their employer-provided benefits.
2. **Retail Account Users**: Individuals who purchased MetLife products directly.
3. **Group Policy Owners**: Owners of group policies, distinct from individual insured members.

#### Registration Workflow:
1. **Employer Search & Selection**:
   - Users search and select their employer, redirecting to a dedicated employer page.

2. **Registration Form (ULT Registration Application)**:
   - **Personal Information**: Users enter basic details (name, email, phone, DOB, zip, state).
   - **Dynamic Fields**: The bottom fields change based on employer configurations and could include Employee ID or SSN as identifiers.

3. **Account Linking**:
   - MetLife validates the user-provided identifier (Employee ID or SSN).
   - Queries backend databases (MetLife Data Hub, MDS Solar collection) to validate user uniqueness.
   - If multiple records match, further validation is performed using DOB. Persistent ambiguity halts registration.

4. **Risk Profiling & Security Checks**:
   - Third-party risk assessment via IDDataWeb through MetLife Identity Services (MIS).
   - Evaluations include checks against public databases, credit bureaus, and fraud indicators.

5. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Users select the MFA method (SMS or Voice).
   - MFA delivery managed by IDDataWeb.

6. **Credential Creation**:
   - Users create a username/password.
   - Must agree to Terms of Use and Electronic Consent Policy.

#### Technical API Integrations:
- **Channel API**:
  - Consolidates and processes registration payload.
  - Creates profiles across multiple backend systems (IBSC, EDPM).
  - Manages updates to user profiles and linked accounts.

- **MIS (MetLife Identity Services)**:
  - Interfaces with IBSC via LDAP for authentication and profile updates.
  - Provides secure and reliable user identification services.

- **IBSC (Identity & Benefit Services Component)**:
  - Stores user profiles and login credentials.
  - Profiles created/updated by MIS.

- **EDPM (Electronic Document Profile Management)**:
  - Stores detailed user profiles, managing post-login experience.
  - Profiles created or updated based on user input.

#### Backend Data Management:
- **Eligibility Files**:
  - Contain user-benefit eligibility data from employers.
  - Required for non-public registration scenarios.

- **Cosmos DB**:
  - Central database storing user eligibility and profile data.

#### SiteMinder Session Management:
- Successful registration initiates an automatic session with SiteMinder.
- Users automatically redirected to their respective dashboards (employee, employer, or pet portal) based on profile type.

#### Special Considerations:
- Employee IDs internally handled as SSNs by certain backend services for uniformity.
- Public vs Non-public registration scenarios clearly distinguished by eligibility data availability.

#### Error Handling & Logging:
- Specific error codes logged for scenarios like multiple records found, failed validations, or API call failures.
- WebTech teams review error logs for resolution and user communication.

#### Registration Completion & Post-Registration:
- Upon completion, users automatically redirected to a dashboard.
- Users encountering partial registration receive limited temporary access, prompting further action.

This structured process ensures a secure, validated, and user-friendly registration experience.
