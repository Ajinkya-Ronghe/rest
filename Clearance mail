Subject: Urgent: Clearance for Employee Separation â€“ Last Working Day Today

Dear Nipun,

I hope you are doing well.

Today is my last working day at Infosys, and I need to complete the Employee Separation clearance process. My Employee ID is 1254916.

I have already obtained the first-level approval from my manager, Nishchay, and the second-level approval from Tapan. Kindly proceed with the required clearance at the earliest.

Please let me know if any further action is needed from my end. Looking forward to your confirmation.

Best regards,
Ajinkya Avinash Ronghe
