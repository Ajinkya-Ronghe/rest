Here are the basic Java + Spring Boot evaluation questions for 3-year-experience candidates along with practical, expected answers.
👉 Focused on real implementation explanation, not just theoretical definitions — exactly what an interviewer expects at 3 years.
🟢 Core Java – With Answers
1. Difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?
String → Immutable, creates new object if modified.
StringBuilder → Mutable, faster, not thread-safe.
StringBuffer → Mutable, thread-safe (synchronized), slower.
Prefer StringBuilder unless multi-threaded environment.
2. equals() vs == and when to override hashCode()?
== → Compares reference.
equals() → Compares values (if overridden).
Must override hashCode() when overriding equals() to maintain integrity when used inside hash-based collections (like HashMap, HashSet).
3. What is a functional interface?
An interface with only one abstract method. Example:
Copy code
Java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b);
}
Can be used with lambda expressions.
4. How does ConcurrentHashMap work?
It divides the map into multiple segments to reduce locking. Prior to Java 8 it used Segment Locking, now it uses CAS (Compare-And-Swap) and locks only affected buckets.
5. What is immutability?
Class whose state cannot change after creation.
Copy code
Java
public final class Employee {
    private final String name;
    public Employee(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public String getName() { return name; }
}
6. Checked vs Unchecked exception?
Checked: Must handle (IOException, SQLException).
Unchecked: Runtime exceptions (NullPointerException, IllegalArgumentException).
7. final, finally, finalize()?
Keyword
Purpose
final
Constant / prevent override
finally
Block that always runs
finalize()
Called before GC (now deprecated)
8. What is ExecutorService?
Manages thread pool – avoids creating separate threads each time.
Copy code
Java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task"));
executor.shutdown();
9. How does Garbage Collection work?
Automatic memory management using algorithms like mark and sweep. You can trigger hint using System.gc(), but the JVM decides.
10. What is Optional?
Used to avoid NullPointerException.
Copy code
Java
Optional.ofNullable(name).orElse("Default")
🟠 Spring Boot / Spring Core – With Answers
1. Difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller?
Annotation
Usage
@Component
Generic bean
@Service
Business layer
@Repository
DAO layer (adds exception translation)
@Controller
Web layer
2. What is Dependency Injection?
Spring automatically provides required objects instead of the programmer creating them.
3. Bean lifecycle?
Instantiate
Populate properties
@PostConstruct
Use bean
@PreDestroy
Destroy
4. What is @Autowired?
Injects dependencies. Can be done via constructor, setter, or field injection (not recommended).
5. What is inside @SpringBootApplication?
Copy code
Java
@SpringBootConfiguration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan
6. What is auto-configuration?
Spring Boot inspects the classpath and creates default beans unless overridden.
7. .properties vs .yml?
.yml supports structured data and hierarchies.
.properties is flat.
8. RestTemplate vs WebClient?
Feature
RestTemplate
WebClient
Style
Blocking
Non-blocking
Suitable
Monolith
Microservices
9. How to handle global exception?
Using @ControllerAdvice with @ExceptionHandler.
10. How to create scheduled job?
Copy code
Java
@EnableScheduling
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0/5 * * * ?")
public void job() { ... }
🔵 REST API – With Answers
1. GET vs POST vs PUT vs PATCH vs DELETE?
Method
Purpose
Idempotent?
GET
Fetch
Yes
POST
Create
No
PUT
Replace full
Yes
PATCH
Partial update
No
DELETE
Delete
Yes
2. What is Idempotency?
Same request multiple times → Same result.
GET, PUT, DELETE are idempotent. POST is not.
3. Validation using annotations?
Copy code
Java
@Valid
@RequestBody UserDto user
4. API Versioning?
URI: /api/v1/users
Header: X-API-VERSION
Param: ?version=1
5. What is HATEOAS?
Provides links in response to navigate API.
6. JWT security?
Generate token → send in Header → verify using filter.
7. What is CORS?
Allows requests from different origins. Configurable with:
Copy code
Java
@CrossOrigin
8. HTTP status for validation failure?
400 Bad Request.
9. What is Swagger?
API documentation tool using springdoc-openapi.
10. File upload?
Use MultipartFile.
🟣 JPA & DB – With Answers
1. Difference between save() and saveAll()?
save() → one entity
saveAll() → list of entities
2. Relationships?
Copy code
Java
@OneToOne
@OneToMany
@ManyToMany
3. Lazy vs Eager?
Lazy: loads when accessed (default).
Eager: loads immediately.
4. If .getOne() record doesn’t exist?
Throws EntityNotFoundException.
5. Transaction propagation?
MOST USED → REQUIRED.
6. JPQL vs native SQL?
JPQL works with entity names, native uses table names.
7. How to optimize heavy queries?
Use pagination
Use proper indexing
Limit select columns
8. Optimistic vs Pessimistic locking?
Optimistic → Allows concurrency (version control).
Pessimistic → Locks record.
9. Why use @Query?
To write custom queries beyond method naming convention.
10. What is connection pooling?
Reuse DB connections instead of creating new ones.
🔴 Microservices – With Answers
1. Benefits of microservices?
Scalability, independent deployment, fault isolation.
2. How services communicate?
REST API
Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
3. Service discovery?
Using Netflix Eureka or Kubernetes.
4. Circuit breaker?
Avoids cascade failure → Resilience4j.
5. Configuration management?
Spring Cloud Config, or environment variables.
6. API Gateway?
Single entry point (Zuul, Nginx, Kong).
7. Event-driven?
Communication using asynchronous events.
8. Request tracing?
Use Sleuth + Zipkin.
9. Dockerize Spring Boot?
Copy code
Bash
FROM openjdk:17
COPY target/app.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
10. What are 12-Factor App principles?
Set of best practices for cloud-native microservices.
🧪 Testing – With Answers
Use Mockito + JUnit5.
@Mock → mock object, @InjectMocks → inject into class,
@MockBean → mock Spring bean.
Integration testing → use @SpringBootTest.
Use TestRestTemplate for REST API testing.
Use assertThrows() to test exceptions.
💡 Scenario-Based Expected Responses

Use @ConfigurationProperties
Deadlock
Analyze query logs, reduce transaction scope
SSL issue
Import certificate in JVM truststore
Circular dependency
Use constructor injection & @Lazy
