Here are 3 different sets of questions (with answers) based on Java + Spring Boot + REST + Microservices evaluation for 3-year experienced candidates, crafted such that they cannot copy from each other easily.
Each set also includes very basic Git, Linux, Cloud, and GitHub Copilot questions.
I’ve ensured:
✔ Questions differ in structure & examples
✔ Answers reflect same concepts but with different wording
✔ Avoids template-style duplication
✔ Covers fundamentals and practical application
🟩 SET 1 – Candidate A
🔹 Java
What is the difference between String pool and heap?
→ Strings from literals go into String Pool (SCP).
→ If created using new, it goes to Heap.
Why are lambdas used in Java 8?
→ To pass behavior (functions) as parameters, helps reduce boilerplate.
What does volatile keyword do?
→ Guarantees variable visibility across threads.
What is Java Memory Model?
→ Method area, Heap, Stack, PC Register, Native method stack.
🔹 Spring Boot
What is the use of application.properties?
→ To externalize configurations.
What’s the difference between @Autowired and constructor injection?
→ Constructor injection is preferred (immutability + testability).
How does Spring Boot determine default configurations?
→ Using spring.factories file under META-INF.
🔹 REST API
Why should POST not be used for fetching data?
→ It breaks HTTP semantic rules and is non-idempotent.
Explain 404 vs 204.
→ 404 = resource not found. 204 = request successful but no body.
🔹 Microservices
Why is configuration externalized?
→ To modify without redeployment.
What port does Eureka server default use?
→ 8761.
🔹 JPA / DB
How to avoid N+1 query issue?
→ Use JOIN FETCH or change FetchType.
🔹 Git
How do you revert last commit without losing changes?
Copy code

git reset --soft HEAD~1
🔹 Linux
How to view top 10 running processes?
Copy code

top
🔹 Cloud
Name one AWS service for database hosting.
→ RDS.
🔹 GitHub Copilot
How does Copilot help while coding?
→ Suggests completions using machine learning based on context.
🟦 SET 2 – Candidate B
🔹 Java
Difference between Comparable and Comparator?
→ Comparable defines natural ordering (compareTo()), Comparator allows external comparison (compare()).
What is the purpose of transient keyword?
→ Prevents variable from being serialized.
Explain Garbage Collector algorithm briefly.
→ Marks unused objects and clears memory.
🔹 Spring Core & Boot
What is @Bean?
→ Declares method return as Spring-managed bean.
What is the difference between @RestController and @Controller?
→ @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody.
What does the embedded Tomcat do?
→ Runs the application without external web server.
🔹 REST
What status code is sent for invalid login credentials?
→ 401 Unauthorized.
What is statelessness in REST?
→ Each request contains all info; server does not store session.
🔹 Microservices
What are API gateways used for?
→ Authentication, routing, load balancing.
What is Feign client?
→ Declarative HTTP client for calling other microservices.
🔹 JPA
What is optimistic locking?
→ Uses @Version to prevent conflicts.
🔹 Git
How to view commit history in short?
Copy code

git log --oneline
🔹 Linux
How to check which user you are logged in as?
Copy code

whoami
🔹 Cloud
What type of cloud model is AWS?
→ IaaS & PaaS.
🔹 GitHub Copilot
How to use Copilot to generate a method?
→ Start typing comment //create method to calculate tax → press TAB.
🟧 SET 3 – Candidate C
🔹 Java
What is a marker interface? Example?
→ Interface without methods (Serializable, Cloneable).
Explain difference between throw and throws.
→ throw manually throws exception, throws declares it.
What is Java Stream API used for?
→ Processing data collection in functional style.
🔹 Spring Boot
What is the benefit of using @SpringBootApplication?
→ Enables auto-config + comp scan + config class.
How do you run a Spring Boot JAR file?
Copy code

java -jar app.jar
What is actuator in Spring Boot?
→ Provides monitoring endpoints (health, metrics).
🔹 REST API
How to handle validation errors?
→ Using @Valid and BindingResult.
Difference between PUT & PATCH?
→ PUT replaces entire entity, PATCH partially updates.
🔹 Microservices
What is load balancing?
→ Spread requests across instances.
What is Hystrix used for?
→ Fault tolerance / circuit breaking.
🔹 JPA
What does cascade = CascadeType.ALL do?
→ Applies all operations to child entity.
🔹 Git
How to create a new branch & switch to it?
Copy code

git checkout -b feature/login
🔹 Linux
How to read logs live from backend?
Copy code

tail -f app.log
🔹 Cloud
What is horizontal scaling?
→ Adding more instances instead of upgrading hardware.
🔹 GitHub Copilot
Can Copilot generate JUnit test cases?
→ Yes, based on method signature and comments.
