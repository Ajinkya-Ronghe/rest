Hi Shivpujan,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for the recognition through the Insta Award. It truly means a lot to me, and I’m grateful for the guidance and opportunities you’ve provided throughout my journey here.

On another note, as my last working day is approaching, I wanted to revisit the Europe project and the onsite opportunity we discussed earlier. I’m still very eager to contribute and would love to explore if there’s any possibility of proceeding with that.

Please let me know your thoughts or if there’s anything further I need to do from my end to facilitate this process.

Thank you again for your constant support and encouragement!

Best regards,
Ajinkya
