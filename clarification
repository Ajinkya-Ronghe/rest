I wanted to take a moment to seek clarification regarding my current role and career progression within the team.

I’ve noticed that one of our team members, Bhagyashri Jaware, with 4 years of experience, joined Infosys as a System Engineer 1.5 years ago. Despite the current role maturity policy, which should require more tenure or broader skillsets for certain promotions, she has been designated as a Technical Analyst.

In contrast, my promotion has been held back, citing role maturity requirements, even though I have completed 2.5 years at Infosys and have a total of 4.5 years of relevant experience. I also bring strong expertise in Java, Git, Linux, Python, databases, and Angular. Additionally, I have been proactively assisting team members in resolving issues across various technical domains, contributing significantly to the project’s success.

I have consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic, dedication, and problem-solving abilities, and my performance has been recognized with two awards during my tenure. Given my contributions and the experience I bring, I would like to understand what might be missing from my profile that is preventing me from being considered for a promotion.

I am committed to growing and aligning myself with the expectations for career progression. Your guidance on this matter would be invaluable.

Thank you for taking the time to address this concern. I look forward to your feedback.
