1. Removing Duplicates
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| dedup ci_item_computer_name
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
In PostgreSQL, we can achieve the same deduplication by using the DISTINCT clause, or ensuring that we group by the ci_item_computer_name.

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT ci_item_computer_name
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Removes duplicate rows based on the ci_item_computer_name column.
2. Renaming Fields
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| rename 
    ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name", 
    ci_item_chassis_type AS "Chassis Type", 
    ci_custom_tag_custom_tag AS "Custom Tags", 
    ci_item_domain_name AS "Domain Name", 
    ci_item_ip_address AS "IP Address", 
    ci_item_model AS "Model", 
    ci_item_operating_system AS "Operating System", 
    ci_item_os_version AS "OS Version", 
    ci_item_serial_number AS "Serial Number", 
    ci_item_user_name AS "User Name"
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
In SQL, you rename fields using the AS keyword within the SELECT statement.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name",
    ci_item_chassis_type AS "Chassis Type",
    ci_custom_tag_custom_tag AS "Custom Tags",
    ci_item_domain_name AS "Domain Name",
    ci_item_ip_address AS "IP Address",
    ci_item_model AS "Model",
    ci_item_operating_system AS "Operating System",
    ci_item_os_version AS "OS Version",
    ci_item_serial_number AS "Serial Number",
    ci_item_user_name AS "User Name"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: This renames columns to more readable names when selecting data.
3. Getting the Current Timestamp
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| eval timenow=now()
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
In PostgreSQL, you can use the NOW() function to get the current timestamp.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    NOW() AS "timenow"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Fetches the current timestamp (date and time).
4. Formatting the Current Timestamp
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| convert timeformat="%m/%d/%Y" ctime(timenow) AS "ConvertedTimeNow"
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
In PostgreSQL, use the TO_CHAR() function to format the timestamp into the MM/DD/YYYY format.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(NOW(), 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS "ConvertedTimeNow"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Formats the current timestamp (NOW()) into a readable MM/DD/YYYY format.
5. Calculating a Future Timestamp (30 Days Later)
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| eval futuretime = timenow + 2592000
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
In PostgreSQL, you can add a time interval to a timestamp by using INTERVAL.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days' AS "futuretime"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Adds 30 days to the current time to calculate a future timestamp.
6. Formatting the Future Timestamp
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| convert timeformat="%m/%d/%Y" ctime(futuretime) AS "Converted14Days"
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
You can use TO_CHAR to format the calculated future timestamp in PostgreSQL.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days', 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS "Converted14Days"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Formats the future timestamp (30 days from now) into a readable MM/DD/YYYY format.
7. Parsing and Converting the "Last Seen" Field
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| eval ConvertedLastSeen=strptime(ci_item_last_seen_at,"%Y-%m-%d")
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
PostgreSQL already stores dates as timestamps, so there's no need for strptime. If your ci_item_last_seen_at is already in YYYY-MM-DD format, you can convert it directly using TO_TIMESTAMP:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    TO_TIMESTAMP(ci_item_last_seen_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS "ConvertedLastSeen"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Converts the string representation of the ci_item_last_seen_at date into a timestamp.
8. Formatting the "Last Seen" Timestamp
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| eval LastSeen=strftime(ConvertedLastSeen,"%m/%d/%Y")
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
You can format the converted timestamp using TO_CHAR in PostgreSQL:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP(ci_item_last_seen_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS "Last Seen"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Converts and formats the ci_item_last_seen_at timestamp into a MM/DD/YYYY format.
9. Filtering Records Based on the "Last Seen" Date
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| where ConvertedLastSeen <= futuretime
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
You can apply a WHERE clause to filter records based on the ConvertedLastSeen timestamp being less than or equal to the futuretime:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    TO_TIMESTAMP(ci_item_last_seen_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS "ConvertedLastSeen"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report
WHERE TO_TIMESTAMP(ci_item_last_seen_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD') <= NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days';
Purpose: Filters records where the ci_item_last_seen_at timestamp is within the past 30 days.
10. Displaying Specific Fields in a Table
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| table 
    Computer Name, 
    Domain Name, 
    IP Address, 
    Operating System, 
    Model, 
    Chassis Type, 
    Serial Number, 
    Last Seen, 
    User Name
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
In PostgreSQL, you select the fields you want to display:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name",
    ci_item_domain_name AS "Domain Name",
    ci_item_ip_address AS "IP Address",
    ci_item_operating_system AS "Operating System",
    ci_item_model AS "Model",
    ci_item_chassis_type AS "Chassis Type",
    ci_item_serial_number AS "Serial Number",
    TO_CHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP(ci_item_last_seen_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS "Last Seen",
    ci_item_user_name AS "User Name"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report;
Purpose: Displays the selected fields in a query result.
11. Counting Records by "Computer Name"
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| stats count by Computer Name
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
In PostgreSQL, we can group by the ci_item_computer_name and count the records:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name",
    COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report
GROUP BY ci_item_computer_name;
Purpose: Counts the number of records for each unique ci_item_computer_name.
12. Calculating the Total Count of Records
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| stats sum(count) as totalCount
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
You can calculate the total count by summing up the counts from the previous step:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    SUM("count") AS "totalCount"
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name",
        COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report
    GROUP BY ci_item_computer_name
) AS subquery;
Purpose: Sums up the counts to get the total number of records.
13. Displaying the Total Count in a Table
Splunk:
spl
Copy code
| table totalCount
PostgreSQL Equivalent:
You can select the total count field from the subquery:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    SUM("count") AS "totalCount"
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name",
        COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report
    GROUP BY ci_item_computer_name
) AS subquery;
Purpose: Displays the total count of records in a table format.
By following this step-by-step approach, we can successfully convert each part of the Splunk query into an equivalent PostgreSQL query. Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any part!

Absolutely! Let's combine each part step by step to form one complete PostgreSQL query. We'll go through the process of merging each individual part of the query into a single SQL statement that mirrors the functionality of your original Splunk query.

Step 1: Basic SELECT with Field Renaming and Deduplication
We start by selecting the required fields, renaming them as needed, and ensuring we remove duplicates.

sql
Copy code
SELECT DISTINCT 
    ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name",
    ci_item_chassis_type AS "Chassis Type",
    ci_custom_tag_custom_tag AS "Custom Tags",
    ci_item_domain_name AS "Domain Name",
    ci_item_ip_address AS "IP Address",
    ci_item_model AS "Model",
    ci_item_operating_system AS "Operating System",
    ci_item_os_version AS "OS Version",
    ci_item_serial_number AS "Serial Number",
    ci_item_user_name AS "User Name"
FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report
WHERE ci_item_computer_name IS NOT NULL;
What's happening:
We're selecting the fields and renaming them.
The DISTINCT clause ensures there are no duplicate ci_item_computer_name values.
We also filter out records with NULL values in ci_item_computer_name.
Step 2: Add Current Time (timenow) and Future Time (30 Days Later)
We add two calculated fields: one for the current time (timenow) and one for the future time (30 days from now).

sql
Copy code
WITH base_data AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        ci_item_computer_name AS "Computer Name",
        ci_item_chassis_type AS "Chassis Type",
        ci_custom_tag_custom_tag AS "Custom Tags",
        ci_item_domain_name AS "Domain Name",
        ci_item_ip_address AS "IP Address",
        ci_item_model AS "Model",
        ci_item_operating_system AS "Operating System",
        ci_item_os_version AS "OS Version",
        ci_item_serial_number AS "Serial Number",
        ci_item_user_name AS "User Name",
        NOW() AS timenow,
        NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days' AS futuretime,
        ci_item_last_seen_at AS "Last Seen"
    FROM esh_main.ceh_tn_asset_report_fs_hardware_inventory_report
    WHERE ci_item_computer_name IS NOT NULL
)
What's happening:
We use a Common Table Expression (CTE) named base_data to store the selected fields and add two calculated fields:
timenow: the current timestamp using NOW().
futuretime: the timestamp 30 days in the future using NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'.
We still maintain the distinct ci_item_computer_name values and ensure that the computer name is not NULL.
Step 3: Format the Timestamps
Now, we need to format the current time (timenow), the future time (futuretime), and the "Last Seen" timestamp into the MM/DD/YYYY format.

sql
Copy code
, formatted_data AS (
    SELECT 
        "Computer Name",
        "Chassis Type",
        "Custom Tags",
        "Domain Name",
        "IP Address",
        "Model",
        "Operating System",
        "OS Version",
        "Serial Number",
        "User Name",
        TO_CHAR(timenow, 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS "ConvertedTimeNow",
        TO_CHAR(futuretime, 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS "Converted14Days",
        TO_CHAR(TO_TIMESTAMP("Last Seen", 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS "Last Seen Formatted",
        TO_TIMESTAMP("Last Seen", 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS "ConvertedLastSeen",
        timenow,
        futuretime
    FROM base_data
)
What's happening:
We create a second CTE (formatted_data) to apply formatting to the timenow, futuretime, and Last Seen timestamps using the TO_CHAR function to convert them into the MM/DD/YYYY format.
We also parse ci_item_last_seen_at into a proper timestamp (ConvertedLastSeen) using TO_TIMESTAMP.
Step 4: Filter Based on the "Last Seen" Timestamp
Next, we filter the records where the ConvertedLastSeen timestamp is less than or equal to the futuretime (30 days from now).

sql
Copy code
, filtered_data AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM formatted_data
    WHERE "ConvertedLastSeen" <= futuretime
)
What's happening:
This CTE (filtered_data) filters the rows where the ConvertedLastSeen timestamp is within the past 30 days by comparing it with futuretime.
Step 5: Count the Records by "Computer Name"
We group by the ci_item_computer_name (now Computer Name) and count the number of records for each unique computer name.

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    "Computer Name",
    COUNT(*) AS "count"
FROM filtered_data
GROUP BY "Computer Name"
What's happening:
This part groups the records by Computer Name and counts the number of records for each unique computer name using COUNT(*).
Step 6: Calculate the Total Count
Finally, we calculate the total count of all records by summing the individual counts.

sql
Copy code
UNION ALL
SELECT 'totalCount' AS "Computer Name", SUM("count")
FROM (
    SELECT 
        "Computer Name",
        COUNT(*) AS "count"
    FROM filtered_data
    GROUP BY "Computer Name"
) AS grouped_counts;
What's happening:
The UNION ALL combines the individual counts per Computer Name with a total count.
We use a subquery to calculate the total count by summing the individual counts (SUM("count")).
