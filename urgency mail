Hi Gayathri,

I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to request work-from-home for the next few days, as I'm currently traveling to Nagpur due to a medical situation at home. My mother had a shoulder dislocation yesterday, and my presence is needed to support her recovery, especially since my father is also under long-term medication.

I assure you that I will be fully available and continue all my deliverables without interruption.

Please let me know if any approvals or formalities are required from my side.

Thanks for your understanding and support.
